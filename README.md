HELLO! 
I hope you find my projectt intresting . Its main goal is to accept 2 kinds of users customers and administrators.
The first should be able to select a movie of his liking from the available ones choose a date, a time and room from the available ones and finaly seats
Then a <<ticket>> will be produced with the necessery info. 
The second(admin) should be able to manage the movies,dates,times,rooms (add/edit/remove).
See the reservations made and the contact form messages.

I wrote it in php and html and using mainly bootstrap css and javascript.
You can use it as you please !


----IMPORTANT----
TO CHECK THE PAGE YOU NEED XAMP OR MAMP OR WHATEVER YOU CAN MANAGE BETTER. I HAVE INCLUDED THE SQL FILE TO WORK WITH THE PROJECT
IN THE USERS TABLE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FIND THE ADMIN IT'S USERNAME qq PASSWORD qq OR YOU CAN CREATE A NEW USER AND CHANGE THE ATTRIBUTE VALUE IN THE USERS TABLE FROM IS_ADMIN 0 -> 1 
TO ACCESS DASHBOARD AUTOMATICALLY YOU JUST ENTER THE ADMIN UN AND PW AND YOU WILL BE REDIRECTED AUTOMATICALLY
